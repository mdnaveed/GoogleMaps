2.	Selenium WebDriver – used Java Programming language.
3.	IDE Used – IntelliJ.
4.	Build tool used – Maven (captured dependencies needed in the POM.xml).
5.	In order to create a “Jar package” – a main’s Class has been accommodated to start the execution.

The following attributes are required by the tests.
The below presented are the prerequisites to run the tests,
1.	Java must be installed and the “Classpath” should capture the path to JDK.
2.	IntelliJ IDE is needed to run the test as this is not a portable jar.
3.	Maven’s POM.xml captures the dependencies and will therefore doesn’t need anything to install separately.
4.	Stay connected to the internet as the test connects to the Google Maps Web Page.

The procedure to run the tests is as follows:
The test covers 3 scenarios which will execute in sequence, please go to the MainClass Class and give a run, this invokes RunnerTests and thereby the feature.

Note: The Test has been created with Main class in the test area with a motive to generate “ jar Package”.
